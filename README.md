# Python Crash Course
Hi there! 👨🏼‍💻

In this repo, I will add any Python 🐍 file I write with examples, curiosities, or
comments about Python programming language as I read `Python Crash Course` book
from [*Eric Matthes* (@ehmatthes)](https://x.com/ehmatthes) on X.

You can find the **3rd edition** of the book on the `Internet` at:
- Editorial website: [`no starch press` - `Python Crash Course`](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition)
- Amazon: [`Python Crash Course`](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/dp/1718502702?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER)

I am just making this so I can remember all the basics and be sure I go from A
to Z so I do not lose any details.

I hope you find something useful here or just learn about something curious.

Just be sure you enjoy the journey.
