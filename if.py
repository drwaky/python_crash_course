# if Statements

# An 'if' statement tests for a condition and then responds to that condition.

# Syntax:
# if conditional_test:
#     do something

# if-else Statements

# An 'if-else' is similar, but the 'else' statement allows you to define an
# action or set of actions that are executed when the condition is 'False'.

# Syntax:
# if conditional_test:
#     do something
# else:
#     do something else

# the first 'if' or 'elif' that evaluates to 'True'. The block of code just
# after that 'if' or 'elif' is executed and the rest of the tests are skipped.
# If none of the conditions are 'True', the code block under 'else' is executed.

# Syntax:
# if conditional_test_1:
#     do something
# elif conditional_test_2:
#     do something else
# else:
#     do something else
